## Features

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [MySQL Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or any other preferred IDE

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jokes-management-system.git
    cd jokes-management-system
    ```

2. **Setup MySQL Database:**

    - Create a database named `jokesdb`.
    - Run the following SQL script to create the `jokes` table:

        ```sql
        CREATE DATABASE jokesdb;
        USE jokesdb;

        CREATE TABLE jokes (
            id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
            question VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
            answer TEXT NOT NULL
        );
        ```

3. **Update Database Connection String:**

    In the `appsettings.json` file, update the connection string to match your MySQL server configuration:

    ```json
    "ConnectionStrings": {
        "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Database=jokesdb;User=root;Password=yourpassword;"
    }
    ```

4. **Build and Run the Project:**

    Open the project in Visual Studio and run it, or use the .NET CLI:

    ```sh
    dotnet build
    dotnet run
    ```
